    	<h3>Russell Wilson: Quarterback</h3>
                <p>Russell Carrington Wilson (born November 29, 1988) is an American football quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League (NFL). Wilson was selected by the Seahawks with the 12th pick in the third round (75th overall) of the 2012 NFL Draft.</p>
                <p>Wilson played college football for the University of Wisconsin during the 2011 season, in which he set the single season FBS record for passing efficiency (191.8) and led the team to a Big Ten title and the 2012 Rose Bowl. Wilson received the Big Ten Quarterback of the Year award and was named a consensus first-team All-Big Ten and third-team All-American by Yahoo! Sports.</p>
                <p>Wilson played football and baseball for North Carolina State University before transferring to Wisconsin. In 2008, he was named the ACC Rookie of the Year in football and became the first freshman quarterback to receive first team All-ACC honors. Wilson also played minor league baseball for the Tri-City Dust Devils in 2010 and the Asheville Tourists in 2011 as a second baseman.
                Wilson signed a four-year, $2.99 million contract with the Seattle Seahawks on May 7, 2012 and was named the team's starting quarterback on August 26, 2012. In his rookie season Wilson led the Seahawks to a 11-5 regular season record and the divisional round of the NFL playoffs, and was voted the Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Year.</p>

            <h3>Rivalries</h3>
                
                <p>After switching conferences, the Seahawks rejoined the NFC West Division with the Arizona Cardinals, San Francisco 49ers and the St. Louis Rams, becoming division rivals. In the 2012 season, the Seahawks shut out the Cardinals 58 to nothing. In the following game, the Seahawks beat the Bills 50 to 17. Finally, in the next game the Seahawks beat their biggest rival, the 49ers with a win 42 to 13 when the 49ers were doing well. They broke many records in a three week span, including 150 points three games in a row. Most recently, the Seattle Seahawks and the San Francisco 49ers have begun to develop a fierce rivalry, starting with the 49ers hiring of coach Jim Harbaugh in 2011. Since rejoining the NFC West, the Hawks have been 15-14 versus the 49ers. The 49ers haven't had much luck the last 2 games in which the Seahawks outscored San Francisco 71-16. Both of the these games took place at Century Link Field. Colin Kaepernick and the Niners lost their first 2013 season matchup against their NFC West rivals 29-3, with the help of Marshawn Lynch's three touchdowns.</p>

		<h3>VMAC and Training Camps</h3>
            <p>During the Seahawks' first ten seasons, the team's headquarters was at Carillon Point on the shores of Lake Washington. The summer training camps were initially held at Eastern Washington University in Cheney, just southwest of Spokane. When the team's new headquarters across town in Kirkland were completed in 1986, the Seahawks held training camp at home for the next eleven seasons, staying in the dormitories of the adjacent Northwest College. In Dennis Erickson's third season as head coach, the team returned to the hotter and more isolated Cheney in 1997, where they held training camp through 2006. In 2007, training camp returned to their Kirkland facility, because of the scheduled China Bowl game that was later canceled. In 2008, the Seahawks held the first three weeks of camp in Kirkland, then moved to the new 19-acre Virginia Mason Athletic Center (VMAC) on August 18 for the final week of training camp. The new facility, adjacent to Lake Washington in Renton, has four full-size practice fields: three natural grass outdoors and one FieldTurf indoors.</p>

		<h3>2012 Season</h3>
            <p>The 2012 NFL Season started with doubt, as the Seahawks lost their season opener against the Arizona Cardinals, after the highly touted Seattle defense gave up a go-ahead score late in the fourth quarter,and rookie quarterback Russell Wilson failed to throw the game winning touchdown after multiple attempts in the red-zone. However, Russell Wilson and the Seahawks went 4-1 in their next five games en route to an 11-5 overall record. Their 2012 campaign included big wins over the Green Bay Packers, New England Patriots, and San Francisco 49ers. The Seahawks went into the playoffs as the #5 seed and the only team that season to go undefeated at home. In the Wild Card Round, the Seahawks over came a 14-point deficit to defeat the Washington Redskins. However, in the 2013 Divisional Round, overcoming a 20 point, fourth quarter deficit wouldn't be enough to defeat the #1 seed Atlanta Falcons. An ill-advised timeout and a defensive breakdown late in the game cost the Seahawks their season, as they lost, 30-28. QB Russell Wilson won the 2012 Pepsi Max Rookie of the Year award.</p>
